## Notable Projects

* **<a href="https://yang_sacstate.gitlab.io/fall2020_null/">Mockingbird</a>:**
  * Mockingbird is an IoT simulator developed for Dialog Semiconductor. This piece of software is designed to simulate thousands of devices that directly communicate with an IoT server over u60 (twisted pair). Mockingbird's development took the majority of a year and was worked on by a team of 7 students (including myself) as a senior project. The development process followed standard Agile/Scrum procedures. More information about Mockingbird can be found <a href="https://yang_sacstate.gitlab.io/fall2020_null/">here</a>. 

* **<a href="https://github.com/Warthog710/CSC180-Final-Platformer">Panda Runner</a>:**
  * Panda Runner is a custom game developed for my course in Intelligent Systems. The goal of this project was to demonstrate how computer vision can be used to emulate human behavior in video games. The game can be played either by a Tensorflow model or a human player and features a data recorder, model loader, and easy map creation. The game was co-developed with <a href="https://github.com/LoganHollmer">Logan Hollmer</a>.

* **<a href="https://github.com/Warthog710/CSC165-gravity-guys">Gravity Guys</a>:** 
  *  Gravity Guys is a 3D platformer with multiplayer networking with support for 8 players. It was developed for my course in Game Architecture with <a href="https://github.com/JoshHuttonCode">Josh Hutton</a>.

* **<a href="https://github.com/Warthog710/Tower-Defense-Game">Space Force Commander</a>:**
  * Space Force Commander is an Android tower defense game. It features 3 levels, 3 tower types, and 3 enemy types. It was created for my course in Object-Oriented Computer Graphics and was co-developed with <a href="https://github.com/LoganHollmer">Logan Hollmer</a>.

## Random
* I love building computers and finding ways to automate daily tasks.
* My favorite video games are MMORPG's. If I'm not coding you'll probably find me exploring a new world or grinding towards a virtual goal.
